Robosoft AI develops and maintains SMAC, which is a library that aims to make it easier for roboticists to control robot behavior. One of the key ideas in SMAC is that a finite state machines, we'll be referring to finite state machines a lot in this interview, so I'll explain what they are. Before we start. Imagine that you have a lawn mowing robot. Imagine that that robot is powered off, and that you turn it on by pushing a button, it boots up and drives to a field to mow. When it gets to the field, it starts mowing. Once it finishes mowing, it drives home and powers off. This robot has states like powered off, booting up driving, and mowing. The robot also has transitions that occur on events, such as when the robot is turned on by you pressing the power button, or the robot arrives at the grass to mow these transitions change the robot from one state to another. For example, the event of arriving at the field to mow could transition the robot from the state of driving to mowing. So summarizing, a finite state machine is something made up of states like driving, and mowing, and transitions when the robot has reached the destination, or when it has finished mowing. This is the sense think act Podcast. I'm Audrow Nash. Thank you to our founding sponsor open robotics. And now here's my conversation with Brett Aldrich. Would you introduce yourself?",
